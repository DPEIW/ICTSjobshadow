#ICTS #may2024 
9 - 5 - 2024

mainly python stuff
dynesty

Enter some stuff about LIGO detectors



physics of it 
	gravitational waves
	LIGO detectors
		they are what observe the time series data
	binary black hole mergers
	waveform generation
	numerical relativity**

computational challenges in brief and then exapnd on it in more detail

data analysis and parameter 
	minimization - maximum likelihood estimation - chisquared 
	bayesian inference 
	gravitational wave data analysis
		matched filter (understanding of it)

Research ICTS
	operational structure
	usual week
	group activities
	computational resources
	people in ASTROPHYSICAL RELATIVITY group



Covariance matrix
	Read up on vector spaces because it is matrices and all
	fourier transform

noise sensitivity curve
