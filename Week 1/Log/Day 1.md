This is my first day at ICTS in bangalore
Job shadow program

**10:15** 
Reached and had breakfast

**10:30 to 11:30**
Downloaded & setup vsc and tested anaconda and linux vm (wget <link>)

**11:30 to 1** 
attending a lecture on bayesian procedure
(notes in notebook)

SpEC
Spectral Einstein code
https://www.black-holes.org/code/SpEC.html

**1:15 to 2** - Lunch 

**2 to 2:30** 
working on assignment given by vaishak
learn arrays in python

**2:30 to 4** 
Lecture on Linear Algebra 1

Linear vector space
- closure under addition, associativity of addition
- associativity of scalar multiplicatiojn
- distributivity

R is a real vector space of real scalars
R^n is real vector space of n vector 

Properties of <. , .>
1) <x, y> > 0 Vx not equal to 0 = positive definite
2) <x, y> = <y, x> - symmetry
Operation on vectors in R^n 

 Vector can be measured in different scales
 1) Euclidean / 2 - norm 
 2) Manhattan / 1 - norm
 3) Chebyshev / infinity norm
 4) Minkowski / p - norm
 5) Energy Norm

Unit sphere: locus of points at unit distance from origin

Functionals
Let V be a vector space
Any function that maps V into R: f: V -> R is called a functional
f is called linear functional if 
f(x1 + x2) = f(x1) + f(x2) -> additive 
f(ax) = af(x) = homogenous

Example
1) ||x|| is a nonlinear functional

Cauchy Schwarz inequality (CS)

Span of a set of vectors
orthogonal vectors
linearly independent vectors in 2 dimensions - infinite number possible

**4:00** 
more  messing around with numpy 

make the y scale logarithmic

Damped sinusoid equations

Made a jupyter notebook which contains all python activities from day 1


**Reflection**

- ICTS is a nice and open place, I could go around and be wherever I wanted, which was good. Gave me a sense of freedom I guess
- I am thinking that the outcomes of this job shadow program could be 
	- writeup on what other researchers do in the astrophysics and relativity group
	- github repository with the python notebooks of each day's python work
