#ICTS #june2024

**10:30 to 12:00**
Vaishak showed me what he does at ICTS and his area of research.
- Research regarding the gravitational waves emitted from binary blackhole mergers  
- Runs numerical relativity code that analyses the data from LIGO to figure out the 15 parameters of black hole mergers
	- code from sxs and etk
	- also optimizes the numerical relativity code to work better on the supercomputers at ICTS
- Visualization of these mergers using animations made using VisIT  
- Contributes to other git repositories such as [nr catalog tools](https://github.com/vaishakp/nr-catalog-tools) which is a python package that provides a unified high-level interface to multiple catalogs of data products from Numerical Relativity simulations of compact-object binary mergers. It is a derivation of sxs collaboration.

Multi messenger cosmology with next gen gravitational waves detectors and electromagnetic surveys

by Sumit Kumar - Postdoc at Max Planck institute for gravitational Physics

- Observational probes in cosmology
	- CBR
	- SNLa light curves 
		- supernovae
	- Large scale structure of the universe is larger than 10 megaparsec
	- Baryon Acoustic oscillation
		- part of the large scale structures
- Current status of cosmology
	- 69% dark energy
	- 26% dark matter
	- 5% Baryonic matter 
		- includes proton, electron, everything we know
		- Large part of universe is dark energy and dark matter
	- 4 evolutionary stages 
		- Early universe
		- Radiation dominated era
		- Matter dominated era
		- DE: Late time accelerated expansion
- Challenges
	- cosmological constant problem 
	- fine tuning problems
	- true nature of dark energy: eg cosmological constant or scalar field?
	- Nature of dark matter -> Particle DM or modification of gravity
	- Hubble tension
- One
