        <h2>The Development of Mathematics in France since the late XIXth Century</h2>
        <h3>Presenter: Martin Andler, Université de Versailles Saint-Quentin</h3>
        
        <h4>Key Points:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Exchanges in 1542 between France and India</li>
            <li>French mathematicians in India since the 1930s</li>
            <li>IFCAM jointly setup by India and French governments</li>
            <li>Tools of International Cooperation, including:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Exploring: International Emerging Actions</li>
                <li>Consolidating: International Research programs</li>
                <li>Structuring: International Research Laboratories</li>
                <li>Integrating: International Research Centers</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Successful IFCAM with 68 projects and 7 workshops</li>
            <li>Historical overview of French mathematics from the XVI century onwards:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Impact of the French Revolution on education and research</li>
                <li>Decline of Ecole Polytechnique as a scientific institution</li>
                <li>Emergence of Ecole Normale Supérieure as a training ground for scientists</li>
                <li>Impact of wars and reforms on the mathematical community</li>
                <li>Influence of figures like Louis Pasteur and Michel Chasles</li>
                <li>Post-war changes and the establishment of a French school of applied mathematics</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Challenges faced by women in mathematics, especially post-1985</li>
            <li>Reasons for the strength of French mathematics:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Tradition of good teachers attracting good students</li>
                <li>Balance between pure and applied mathematics</li>
                <li>Central role of mathematics in competitive exams</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Conclusion:</h4>
        <p>While French mathematics is currently strong, the future remains uncertain due to fluctuating trends in education and research funding.</p>
