#ICTS #may2024 
- was supposed to go to icts today, but we couldn't coordinate properly, so I couldn't go.

		- Mechanisms and tools of International cooperation
			- by Srini Kaveri who is representative of CNRS of india
				- CNRS - CISR
				- UMR = Unite MIxte de Recherche = Joint reserach unit
					- system is very flexible, as long as you have research it can be evaluated 
				- in CNRS they observe every branch of science
					- budget is over 3,7 bn euro per year
					- 32000 staff 
					- 55000 publications per year 60% international collaboration
					- 6th in patent filling
					- 23 nobel laureates
					- 80 research labs
					- 10 offices all over the world, many in asia
				- Tools of cooperation with CNRS
					- Exploring - International Emerging Actions, allows you to go and collaborate and travel, 4-5 page project 
					- Consolidating - allows you to meet 2 times a year. discuss to create more projects, which u can submit to cnrs
						- International Research programs - 5 year lab to lab collaborative research programmes (activities for 5 years)
					- Structuring - International Research Laboratories, extremely powerful research collaboration, and could give good grants 
					- Integrating - International Research Centers, multi project networks, programs, etc
				- IFCAM has been successful, has taken through 68 projects and 7 workshops etc
					- Very successful programs
				- ReLaX
					- CNRS, Universite de Bordeaux, ENSPS, 
					- Chennai Mathematical Institute, Institute of Mathematical Sciences
					- Centers in pondicherry and delhi
				- International Research Networks
				- Different Fellowships as well
		- **Development of Mathematics in France since the late XIXthe Century** 
			- by Martin Andler, universite de versailles saint quentin
			- Intr XVI century
				- Viete Descartes, Pascal, Fermat, Desargues
			- 1789 French revolution impact
				- were strong in 13th 14th century, but after in 18th century they closed the universities because they believed it was spreading teaching of church
				- Ecole Polytechnique vs Ecole normale superieure
					- polytechnique - for engineers and officers (military school)
						- conservatory of french science
						- dominant institute for science in france for first of 19th century
						- the graduates are very close to mathematicians and who we know today as mathematicians in books etc
						- 
					- normale superieure - scientists
						- graduates are scientists (short list)
							- bouquet, tannery
					- 1850 - 1870
						- we see polytechnique's decline as a scientific institution
						- decided in 1850 that polytechnique should abandon role of being scientific insitutions
						- preferred to hire professors who were more practically minded eg engineers
						- Ecole Normale Superiure slow ascent
							- a biologist wanted normal superiure to train scientists
						- The rise of germany as a power science
							- Gauss, jacobi, kummer, riemann
						- Rise of russia italy as well in mid 19th century
					- french scientists call for action
						- Louis Pasteur - saying that France is not yet at work, has been sleeping under shadow of past trophies
						- Michel Chasles - two branches of science prosper in germany, england and italy but not in any french schools
					- War played a big role in france training its officers
					- had an impact on german as well, superiority of french army linked with superiorty of training
					- in 1870 very few active mathematicians
					- defeat for french after war with prussia
					- 3rd republic's reforms
						- in the last years of napoleon 3's reign, number of reforms had been made to foster research
						- after 1870, there was a reform in the educational system
							- institutional changes
							- new buildings in france main cities
							- new professorial chairs
						- new universities in paris
					- Chasles and Darboux
						- Darboux and Houel launch Bulletin des sciences mathematiques 
							- goal - open french mathematics to the world
								- published translations of papers, comments on foreign papers
					- Ecole normale superieure (ENS)
						- during 1794 to 1860 ENS produced few top mathematicians
						- Pasteur became dean of studies at ENS
							- intention to transform ENS into a institution training academics
							- convinced Darboux and Picard to attend ENS instead of Polytechnique which established decline of polytechnique
						- 1870 - ENS 0, Polytechnique 6; 1924 ENS 7, Polytechnique 0
						- Next generation 
							- less brilliant and successful
								- careers were much slower maybe the opportunities were not there 
						- Great war affected many people
							- half of graduates were killed in the war
								- Gaston Julia was wounded but still wrote his thesis - didnt have half his face
						- Generation without masters
							- when post war students started their studies in 1920s most of professors were not so active 
							- some sought inspiration by travling to germany, to gottingen, hamburg and elsewhere, where modern algebra was being developed
						- 1930 - 40
							- not much change in 1920's 
							- paris is only university where they might have an impact
							- nicolas bourbaki 
						- 1945 - 55
							- Bourbaki
							- ICM in cambridge gave bourbaki members a big recognition with the fields medal for laurent schwartz and other invited speakers
							- other fields medals followed for his students
						- Leray Paradox
							- fluid mechanics, partial differntial equations, major papers on 2d navier stokes equation
							- pioneer in applied mathematics
							- taken as a prisoner during the war
							- understanding localize submarines was a big issue and didn't wnat to help germans
							- decided to be mathematician and he invented spectral sequences and sheaf theory
						- Bourbaki had inspiring but narrow perspective on mathematics
							- pure mathematics is better and not all of mathematics is interesting
							- some fields lauded (number theory, algebraic geometry) others were looked down upon
						- Polytechnique resumed training research mathematics in early 60's
						- Emergence of french school of applied mathematics
							- Jacques louis lions
								- ENS graduate
								- evolution to applied mathematics in teh late 50's and 60's 
								- Empire builders
								- students were called french word for "baby of lions"
						- Emergence of a french schoool of probability theory
							- 1972 - oil crisis
							- 73 - 75 - brutal end to the expansion of the university system
							- beginning of a very difficult decade
						- Gender issues - 1985 disasters
							- there was as school to train feamle students
							- ENS de jeunes filles
							- originally created to train women to teach in high schools for girls, it changed its focus in the 1950s to prepare its students for research
							- 1985 ENS and ENSJF merged and in mathematics and physics the number of women decreased substantially
							- major negative impact in the number of women engaged in academic careers in mathematics
					- impact of a pro research agenda
						- increase in research funding
						- positive impact on science and research 
						- % of french speakers in ICM has been increasing since 1950's 
						- no. of fields's medals also increased 
				- Concl. **Why is french mathematics so strong**
					-  tradition - good teachers attract good students
					- prejudice still exists against applied mathematics in some circles but situation bw pure/applied is balanced
					- mathematics is cheaper and does not require big infrastructures
					- Mathematics has a central role by tradition because they rely very much on competitive exams
					- there are fluctuations, french mathematics is strong but the future is never guaranteed
