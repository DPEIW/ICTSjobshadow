**11:45 to 1:00** Introduction to extended ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA)|
[eROSITA on SRG event](https://www.icts.res.in/event/page/28735)
Highlights from the all sky survey
- by Andrea Merloni ([MPE](https://www.mpe.mpg.de/eROSITA))
	- 



- all data of eROSITA can be found at [eROSITA data](https://erosita.mpe.mpg.de/dr1/)
- every 50msec they readout the CCD (frame readout cycle)
- quasi periodic eruptions from two previously quiescent galaxies
- [Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17306)

conclusions
- most poswerful wide field xray telescope to date
- been in operation since q3 2019 for more than 2 years 
- it opens up new parameter space for xray astronomy thanks to its large grasp, 


**2:00 to 2:45** Science Results from eROSITA
- cluster abundance as a comsmological probe 
- legrange point 
	- Lagrange points are locations in space where the gravitational forces of two large bodies, like the Sun and Earth, are equal to the centripetal force needed for a smaller object to move with them. They are also known as libration points. [source](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/resources/faq/what-are-lagrange-points/#:~:text=Lagrange%20Points:%20What%20are%20they,object%20to%20move%20with%20them.)
	- basically the analysis and explanation of data collected by the eROSITA telescope 
	- eRASSI cosmological results - ACDM
	- measured the cosmological parameters with eRASSI, the largest ICM selected cluster sample to date
	- they do not find the traces of the S8
	- More results to come on the growth of structures

- decided to make a website so i can also show html skills, so i have started work on that too. 

**3:30 to 4:15** [COSMIC REVELATION: QUEST FOR DARK ENERGY](https://www.icts.res.in/colloquium/2024-05-22/shadab-alam)

- Homogeneous? and isotropic? universe
	- Einstein Field Equation
	- FLRW metric
	- Hubble's rate
- Different phases of the universe
	- Density evolution 
	- p inverse a ^(-3(w+1))
	- w = 0(matter), w = 1/3(radiation), w =-1(dark energy)
- Dark energy
	- remarkable properties
		- pressure must be negative to drive cosmic acceleration
		- consist of 70% of current energy content of the universe
	- equation of state w(de) of dark energy is the key
		- w(de) = p(de)(z)/rho(de)(z)
			- w(de) less than equal to -1 = quentessence (additional scalar field)
			- w(de) more than equal to -1 = phantom: big rip, ghost (negative kinetic term)
			- w(de) cross -1 = No-Go theorem with single field or scalar field. [Quintom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintom_scenario)
	- DESI y1 Sample
		- margine of error decreases and confidence increases as different modules are added? Pantheon, union3 or des-sn5yr
	- Baryon Acoustic Oscillation
		- photon carries baryon to a certain distance and it becomes a baryon 
		- at a certain point baryon and dark matter becomes same
		- 3d position in the sky
		- RA, DEC (x, y) measured and spectra to get redshift (z)
		- BAO in fourier space
			- do fourier transform/ correlation function
	- DESI (dark energy spectroscopy instrument) Legacy Imaging Survey
		- 6+ years of taking imaging of night sky
		- Detected 1.5 b galaxies and 1.3 b stars
		- But for BAO you need spectra of galaxies
		- DESI can take 5000 spectra at a time 
			- can measure 5000 galaxies
		- 4000 spectra x 8 hrs x 2 (per hour) = 64,000 spectra per night 
		- 64,000 x 365 days x 5 years x 0.5 efficiency ~ 58 m galaxies
		- 58m/1.5 b ~ 0.04 fraction of source possible to observe
		- how to select the 4% for best cosmological constraint
		- SNR ~~ Pi/\sqrt(Cii)
	- Summary
		- DESI instrument with 5000 optical fibres
			- 10+years of designing, 600 crore inr cost
		- select objects to obtain best cosmology
		- based on n * P - 1
