      I am Pranav and I am a grade 11 IBDP student at OWIS. Over the summer of 2024, I did a job shadow program under Dr. Vaishak Prasad at the International Center for Theoretical Sciences. 
      <br> </br>
      A Job shadow program helps students understand being a part of a professional organization. It demonstrates interest in research and serves as an orientation to working in that respective field. As I am interested in pursuing computer/electrical engineering for my further studies, and my hobbies (computing, computer hardware, 3D modeling, and Python programming) revolve around similar disciplines, I nominated ICTS for this experience. The research done here makes use of computation methods extensively and the learning would help with my future endeavors. 
      <br> </br>
      During the program, I observed the work done at this research institution, the tools and methods used for that work and understood the process by which the researchers achieve their professional goals. I also attended group meetings, faculty seminars and did some original Python work using the newly acquired skills. 
      <br> </br>
      This is a compilation of all the resources created during the Job Shadow program.
