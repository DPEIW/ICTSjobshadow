	- dont seem to address any numerical sources, only physical sources
		- nrv sources 
	- listed possible reasons and does not go into that much of detail 
	- there are no figures in the document by choice 
	- not about physics but more about physical sources 
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05318
	- it is a convoluted way to write
		- whether they really did it from the masses
	- only the sky location and time and brightness of the flares and the brightness should also be related to the mass
	- brightness related to mass and gas
	- if the black hole is more massive then there is more gas
	- systematic more flare activity if the black hole is massive
	- AGN flares

	- publically available data set from LISA 
	- catalog of possible sources 
	- dont know parameters
	- analysing real LISA data and can be used for simulations
	- used for software development 
	- markov chain monte carlo implemented on gpu
		- fold the data which you get from LISA
	- have they compared cpu vs gpu
		- NERYN
	- used nvidia a100 and 12 cpu
	- dont think there is any machine learning like training over here

	- formation channel of neutron stars (factcheck)
	- redefining many events
	- surprised that they can claim which one formed first
	- how do they decide what came first
		- prior and then posterior estimation
	- one object is a neutron star and another is black hole do we use information to construct priors using ()
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03607
	- when spins are gravitationally oriented, the radiation is not symmetric. 
	- this is also motivated by fact that equal mass binaries form largest kicks
		- however asymmetric mass binaries form largest kicks
		- equal mass binaries largest kicks is wrong so it is either a typo or something is not understood fully
