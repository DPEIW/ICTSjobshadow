      <h2>Day 1 - 6th May 2024</h2>
      <p><strong>10:15</strong> - Reached ICTS and had breakfast.</p>
      
      <p><strong>10:30 to 11:30</strong> - Set up Visual Studio Code, tested Anaconda, and configured a Linux virtual machine.</p>
      
      <p><strong>11:30 to 1:00</strong> - Attended a lecture on Bayesian procedures, including notes on the <a href="https://www.black-holes.org/code/SpEC.html" target="_blank">Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC)</a> for simulating black hole systems.</p>

      <p><strong>1:15 to 2:00</strong> - Lunch break.</p>
      
      <p><strong>2:00 to 2:30</strong> - Worked on Python assignments to learn about arrays and plotting graphs.</p>

      <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> ICTS is a welcoming space with an open environment. This week, I aim to create a write-up about the researchers’ work and a GitHub repository of my Python activities.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Day 2 - 8th May 2024</h2>
    <p><strong>10:30 to 11:15</strong> - Learned about normal distributions and probability contours on the way to ICTS.</p>

    <p><strong>11:30</strong> - Visited ICTS’s supercomputer, "Sonic," learning about its architecture and capabilities for high-performance and high-throughput computing.</p>

    <p><strong>12:00 to 1:00</strong> - Participated in a group discussion on recent astrophysics research papers from <a href="https://arxiv.org/" target="_blank">arXiv</a>, led by PhD fellows. Topics included gravitational-wave selection effects, lensing, and black hole mergers. 
    <a href="meeting-notes.html" target="_blank">View meeting notes</a></p>

    <p><strong>2:00 to end of day</strong> - Worked on a Python notebook for extracting parameters from a damped sinusoid wave. (See "Day 2 Assignment" notebook for details.)</p>

    <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> Today, I was inspired by the use of high-power computing for solving real-world scientific problems, different from commercial tech applications.</p>

  <section>
      <h2>Day 3 - 9th May 2024</h2>
      <p>Focused on Python and concepts related to gravitational wave analysis. Learned about:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>LIGO detectors and the physics of gravitational waves.</li>
          <li>Bayesian inference, data analysis techniques, and parameter estimation for gravitational wave data.</li>
          <li>Covariance matrix and Fourier transforms in data processing.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Continued working on Python assignments in Jupyter Notebooks, diving deeper into numerical analysis methods.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
      <h2>Day 3 at Home - 13th May 2024</h2>
      <p>Set up the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) for an integrated development environment. Installed necessary software:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Anaconda, Git, and VSCode extensions for SSH</li>
          <li>GUI apps like Firefox and Nautilus for a complete Linux experience</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Reviewed and explored resources on parameter estimation.</p>
